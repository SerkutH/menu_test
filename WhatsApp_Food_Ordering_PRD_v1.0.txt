WhatsApp-Native Food Ordering PlatformMenu Builder & Ordering FlowProduct Requirements Document (PRD) Ñ v1.0Document OwnerBSP Product TeamVersion1.0 Ñ Initial ReleaseStatusDraft Ñ Ready for Design & DevPayment GatewayZotloChannelWhatsApp (via Official BSP)1. Executive SummaryFood delivery platforms in Turkey (Yemeksepeti, Trendyol Go, Getir Food) charge restaurants commissions ranging from 20% to 35% per order. This creates a structural margin problem for restaurant owners, who simultaneously pay high commissions AND lose direct customer relationships.This platform enables any restaurant to receive orders directly through WhatsApp Ñ the messaging channel already used by 90%+ of Turkish consumers Ñ with no per-order commission. Restaurants pay only for WhatsApp Business API messages through the BSP.The core delivery is a no-code Menu Builder (SaaS) for restaurant owners, a hosted customer-facing Order Page (web app) linked from WhatsApp template messages, and a Zotlo-powered payment flow Ñ all orchestrated by a backend that sends automated WhatsApp notifications at each order lifecycle event.2. Problem Statement2.1  Restaurant-Side PainPain PointCurrent ImpactHigh commission fees20Ð35% per order paid to aggregators, destroying net margins for thin-margin businesses.No customer data ownershipAggregators own the customer relationship; restaurants cannot market to repeat buyers.Menu rigidityChanges on aggregator platforms can take hours or require back-office support.Forced promotionsAggregators push restaurants into discount campaigns to gain visibility.No direct communication channelRestaurants cannot message customers about new items, offers, or order status updates themselves.2.2  Customer-Side Pain¥ Customers already use WhatsApp daily and prefer not to switch apps for ordering.¥ No easy direct-order channel for restaurants they already know and trust.¥ Aggregator apps surface competitors; customers sometimes lose their preferred restaurant in algorithm changes.3. Goals & Success MetricsGoalKPITarget (6 months)Zero per-order commission for restaurantsAvg. commission cost per order< 3% (WA API message cost only)Restaurant self-service onboardingTime to first live menu< 30 minutesHigh order conversionCart-to-paid conversion rate> 70%Payment success rateSuccessful Zotlo payment / attempts> 95%Customer satisfactionPost-order WhatsApp CSAT score> 4.2 / 54. User Personas4.1  Persona A Ñ Ahmet (Restaurant Owner)AttributeDetailRoleOwner of a mid-size kebab restaurant in ?stanbul, 40 seats, ~120 orders/day.Tech comfortUses WhatsApp and Instagram daily. Not a developer.Primary goalReduce Yemeksepeti commission; keep loyal customers ordering directly.PainCannot afford a custom app; commission erodes profit on every order.Needs from productA dead-simple menu builder he can update himself; automatic order notifications without a tablet running all day.4.2  Persona B Ñ Selin (Customer)AttributeDetailRoleRegular customer of Ahmet's restaurant. Orders 3x/week.Tech comfortHeavy WhatsApp user; comfortable with mobile payments.Primary goalQuickly order her usual meal without opening another app.PainAggregators sometimes remove her favourite restaurant; confusing upsell flows.Needs from productFast, clean ordering page that remembers her preferences; clear delivery/pickup info; instant confirmation on WhatsApp.4.3  Persona C Ñ BSP Operations (Internal)¥ Needs an admin dashboard to onboard/manage restaurant accounts.¥ Needs per-restaurant API credential management and Zotlo integration keys.¥ Needs visibility into message delivery, order volume, and payment failures.5. High-Level User Journeys5.1  Customer Ordering JourneyStepActorChannelAction / System Response1CustomerWhatsAppCustomer sends any message to the restaurant's WhatsApp number (e.g. 'sipari?' / 'menu' / 'hello').2SystemWA APIBackend triggers an approved WhatsApp Template Message containing the restaurant name, a short greeting, and a deep-link button labelled 'View Menu & Order'.3CustomerBrowserCustomer taps the link; hosted Order Page loads with restaurant branding, categories, and items.4CustomerBrowserCustomer browses, configures items (toppings, removals, extras, quantity), adds to cart.5CustomerBrowserCustomer selects delivery or pick-up, fills address (if delivery), chooses payment method.6CustomerBrowserCustomer reviews order summary and taps 'Confirm & Pay'.7SystemZotloZotlo payment session opens (credit card / bank transfer / digital wallet). Customer completes payment.8SystemWA APIOn Zotlo webhook 'payment.success', backend sends Order Confirmation Template to the customer's WhatsApp number.9SystemWA APIOn status updates (preparing / out for delivery / delivered), backend sends further Template Messages.5.2  Restaurant Onboarding Journey1. Restaurant owner contacts BSP sales or self-registers on the BSP portal.2. BSP team (or automated flow) provisions a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) phone number.3. Restaurant owner logs into the Menu Builder Dashboard.4. Owner fills in business profile: name, logo, cover image, address, delivery zones, working hours.5. Owner creates menu categories and items; configures modifier groups (see Section 7).6. Owner connects Zotlo account (API key + merchant ID).7. Owner sets order notification preferences (WhatsApp number for new order alerts).8. System generates a unique Order Page URL and QR code.9. Owner publishes menu. Status changes from 'Draft' to 'Live'.6. System Architecture Overview6.1  Component MapComponentTechnology (Recommendation)ResponsibilityMenu Builder (FE)React / Next.js SPARestaurant owner's no-code editor for building and managing menus.Order Page (FE)React / Next.js (SSR for SEO & fast load)Customer-facing, mobile-first ordering UI. Hosted at: orders.yourdomain.com/{slug}Backend APINode.js + Express or NestJSCore business logic: menu CRUD, order lifecycle, WhatsApp message dispatch, Zotlo webhook handler.WhatsApp LayerBSP's existing WA Business APISend/receive WhatsApp messages using approved templates.Payment LayerZotlo Payment APICreate payment sessions, handle webhooks for success/failure/refund.DatabasePostgreSQLStores restaurants, menus, items, modifiers, orders, customers.File StorageS3-compatible (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2)Menu item images, restaurant logos, cover images.Queue / JobsBullMQ (Redis-backed)Async WhatsApp message sending, retry logic for failed WA deliveries.BSP Admin PanelReact (internal)BSP staff: onboard restaurants, view logs, manage API keys.6.2  High-Level Data Flow¥ Customer WA message ? BSP Webhook ? Backend ? Template Message dispatched with Order Page URL.¥ Customer opens URL ? Order Page fetches menu from Backend API ? Customer builds cart.¥ Customer submits order ? Backend creates Order record (status: PENDING_PAYMENT) ? Zotlo session created ? redirect/modal.¥ Zotlo webhook (payment.success) ? Backend updates Order (status: PAID) ? WA Confirmation Template sent to customer ? WA New Order Alert sent to restaurant.¥ Restaurant marks order status via their mini-dashboard or API ? Backend sends corresponding WA status update to customer.7. Menu Builder Ñ Functional Specification (Frontend)7.1  Restaurant Profile Settings¥ Restaurant name, tagline, logo (1:1 image, min 400?400px), cover image (16:9).¥ Cuisine tags (multi-select from predefined list).¥ Average preparation time (minutes), minimum order amount (TRY).¥ Delivery options: Delivery only | Pick-up only | Both.¥ Delivery zones: radius in km OR manually drawn polygon on map OR list of postal codes.¥ Delivery fee: flat fee, distance-based tiers, or free above a threshold.¥ Working hours: per-day open/close time + optional lunch break. Toggle 'Closed today'.¥ Order acceptance: Auto-accept all orders OR Manual accept (restaurant must confirm each order).7.2  Menu StructureThe menu is structured as: Menu ? Categories ? Items ? Modifier Groups ? Modifier Options.EntityFieldsNotesMenuname, status (DRAFT / LIVE / SCHEDULED), schedule (optional date range)One restaurant can have multiple menus (e.g. lunch, dinner, Ramadan special). Only one is LIVE at a time.Categoryname, description (optional), image (optional), display_order, visibility (always / time-based)Time-based: e.g. 'Breakfast' visible only 08:00Ð11:00.Itemname, description, image, base_price, tax_rate, tags (vegan/gluten-free/spicy/etc.), stock_status (available / sold_out / hidden), display_order, prep_time_overrideImage guidelines: 4:3 or square, min 600px wide.Modifier Groupname, type (SINGLE / MULTIPLE), required (yes/no), min_selections, max_selections, display_orderExample: 'Remove ingredients' (type: MULTIPLE, required: no, max: unlimited).Modifier Optionname, price_delta (+/- TRY or 0), is_default (pre-selected), stock_statusprice_delta = 0 for free choices (e.g. 'Remove onion'), positive for add-ons (e.g. '+ Extra Cheese +15 TRY').7.3  Modifier Group Types Ñ Detailed Behaviour7.3.1  SINGLE-SELECT (Radio)¥ Customer must pick exactly one option from the group.¥ Use cases: Size (Small / Medium / Large), Crust type (Thin / Thick / Stuffed).¥ If required = true and no default is set, the 'Add to Cart' button remains disabled until selection.¥ Rendered as: radio buttons (mobile) / segmented control (desktop).7.3.2  MULTI-SELECT (Checkbox)¥ Customer can pick 0 to N options (bounded by min_selections and max_selections).¥ Use cases: Extra toppings (pick up to 3), Sides (pick any 2).¥ Counter badge shows 'X / max selected' as customer picks.¥ If min_selections > 0 and not met, 'Add to Cart' remains disabled with inline error.¥ Rendered as: checkboxes with price delta badges.7.3.3  REMOVAL GROUP (special case of MULTI-SELECT)This is the key differentiator inspired by Yemeksepeti / Trendyol Go Ñ 'Which ingredients do you want REMOVED?'¥ All ingredient options have price_delta = 0 and is_default = false (nothing removed by default).¥ The group name should be displayed as 'Remove from your order' or customisable by restaurant.¥ Rendered as: ingredient chips/tags Ñ tapping toggles a strikethrough + red 'X' indicator on the chip.¥ Summary line in cart shows: '? Onion, ? Tomato'.7.3.4  MIXED ADD/REMOVE GROUP¥ Same item can have both add and remove options across separate modifier groups.¥ Example Ñ Mixed Pizza: Modifier Group 1 (Remove): Mushrooms, Peppers, Olives | Modifier Group 2 (Add, +price): Extra Cheese +15?, Double Salami +20?.7.4  Item Configuration UI Ñ Step-by-step Wireframe Logic10. Restaurant owner clicks '+  Add Item' inside a category.11. Modal / slide-over panel opens with tabs: [Basic Info] [Modifiers] [Availability].12. Basic Info tab: upload image, fill name, description, price, tax rate, dietary tags.13. Modifiers tab: list of existing modifier groups with drag handles for reordering. CTA: 'Add Modifier Group'.14. 'Add Modifier Group' opens nested panel: choose type (SINGLE / MULTI / REMOVAL), set name, required toggle, min/max, then add options one by one (name + price delta + default toggle).15. Availability tab: toggle 'Available now', set scheduled hidden times, set stock status.16. Save button persists changes instantly via API; preview updates in real time on a side-by-side phone mockup.7.5  Bulk Operations¥ CSV import for mass item creation (template downloadable from dashboard).¥ Duplicate item (copies all modifiers to new item, appends '(Copy)' to name).¥ Duplicate category (deep clone including all items and modifier groups).¥ Batch price update: select multiple items ? 'Increase prices by X%' or 'Set price to X'.¥ Sold out toggle: mark entire category as sold out with one click (useful for end-of-day items).8.

Create both variants for bilingual support.¥ 'order_menu_link' is the entry-point template. Use category: MARKETING with opt-in confirmation. Ensure opt-in mechanism is in place at WABA number onboarding.¥ 'order_confirmation' and status updates are UTILITY category Ñ lower cost, no opt-in required once order is placed.11. Zotlo Payment Integration11.1  Integration Flow17. Backend calls Zotlo 'Create Payment Session' API with: amount (kuru?/pence), currency (TRY), order_id (external reference), customer_phone, callback_url (Zotlo redirect after payment), webhook_url (Zotlo server-to-server callback).18. Zotlo returns a session URL. Backend returns this URL to the Order Page frontend.19. Frontend opens Zotlo URL in an iframe/bottom sheet or redirects to it (Zotlo's recommendation should be followed for mobile UX).20. Customer completes payment on Zotlo-hosted page.21. Zotlo sends server-to-server webhook to /webhooks/zotlo. Backend verifies HMAC signature.22. On 'payment.success': Backend updates Order status to PAID, triggers WA confirmation template.23. On 'payment.failed' or 'payment.cancelled': Backend updates Order status, triggers WA retry template.11.2  Webhook Event HandlingZotlo EventBackend Actionpayment.successUpdate Order.status = PAID, Order.zotlo_payment_id. Send WA order_confirmation to customer. Send WA new_order_alert to restaurant.payment.failedUpdate Order.status = PAYMENT_FAILED. Send WA payment_failed to customer with retry link.payment.cancelledUpdate Order.status = CANCELLED. No WA message unless restaurant configures it.refund.successUpdate Order.status = REFUNDED. Send WA refund confirmation (phase 2 template).11.3  Security Requirements¥ Zotlo webhook endpoint validates HMAC-SHA256 signature on every incoming request. Reject and log any request failing validation.¥ Zotlo API keys stored encrypted at rest (AES-256). Never returned in API responses.¥ Payment amounts are always calculated server-side Ñ never trust the frontend for final price.¥ Implement idempotency: if same Zotlo webhook arrives twice (retry), do not double-process.12. Restaurant Dashboard Ñ UI Specification12.1  Navigation Structure¥ Sidebar (desktop) / Bottom nav (mobile): Overview | Orders | Menu | Settings | Analytics.12.2  Overview (Home)¥ Today's stats cards: Total Orders, Total Revenue, Avg. Order Value, Pending Orders count.¥ Live order feed (real-time via WebSocket): new orders appear at top with pulsing badge. Each card shows: Order #, time received, items summary, total, delivery type, customer note. Actions: 'Accept' / 'Reject' (if manual-accept mode) and status progression buttons.12.3  Orders List¥ Tabbed view: All | Pending | Preparing | On the Way | Delivered | Cancelled.¥ Search by order ID or customer phone (last 4 digits).¥ Date range picker. Export to CSV.¥ Order detail drawer: full item list, modifier summary, customer address on map, payment info, WA message history for that order.12.4  Menu Editor¥ This is the core Menu Builder described in Section 7.¥ Live preview toggle: right-side panel shows phone mockup of current menu state.¥ 'Publish' button with confirmation modal showing diff summary of changes.12.5  Settings¥ Business Profile (Section 7.1).¥ Payment: Zotlo API key and Merchant ID entry. 'Test Connection' button.¥ Notifications: which phone number receives new order WA alerts. Option to also receive email.¥ Team: invite additional staff accounts (role: Manager / Viewer only Ñ no payment settings access).12.6  Analytics (Phase 2)¥ Revenue over time chart, top-selling items, peak order hours heatmap, repeat customer rate, modifier popularity (most removed ingredient, most added extra).13. Non-Functional RequirementsRequirementTargetOrder Page load time (3G mobile)< 3 seconds Time to Interactive (TTI)API response time (menu fetch)< 500ms p99WhatsApp message dispatch latency< 5 seconds from trigger eventUptime (Order Page + API)99.9% monthly SLAConcurrent sessions per restaurantSupport 500 simultaneous Order Page sessions without degradationData retentionOrders retained for 3 years (legal requirement Turkey Ñ e-commerce law)GDPR / KVKK complianceCustomer phone numbers hashed at rest. Privacy policy linked on Order Page. Data deletion on customer request.Payment securityPCI-DSS handled by Zotlo. No card data touches BSP infrastructure.14. Out of Scope (Phase 1)¥ Native iOS / Android apps.¥ AI-powered order suggestions or upsells.¥ Multi-branch restaurant management (single restaurant per account in Phase 1).¥ Rider / delivery management (restaurants manage their own delivery or use partner couriers).¥ Scheduled orders ('order for tomorrow 19:00').¥ Loyalty points or voucher codes.¥ Table-side QR ordering (dine-in mode).¥ Reviews and ratings.¥ Multi-language menus per restaurant.15. Acceptance Criteria Ñ Definition of DoneFeatureAcceptance TestMenu Builder Ñ Removal GroupGiven a pizza with ingredient modifiers; when customer selects 'Remove Mushrooms' and 'Remove Peppers'; then cart line shows 'Mixed Pizza Ñ without: Mushrooms, Peppers'; and order record contains removal modifiers with price_delta = 0.Quantity stepperGiven item in cart with quantity 2; when customer taps '?'; then quantity becomes 1. When tapped again; quantity becomes 0 and item is removed from cart.Add to Cart guardGiven a required single-select modifier group with no default; when customer opens item detail; then 'Add to Cart' button is disabled. After selecting an option, button becomes enabled.Zotlo payment flowGiven a complete order submitted; when Zotlo sends payment.success webhook; then order status changes to PAID within 5 seconds; AND customer receives WA confirmation message within 10 seconds.Restaurant closed stateGiven restaurant working hours end at 22:00; when customer opens Order Page at 22:05; then a 'Closed' banner is displayed with next open time; AND the cart checkout button is disabled.Duplicate webhook protectionGiven Zotlo sends the same payment.success event twice; then the order is updated once only; AND only one WA confirmation message is sent to the customer.16.
